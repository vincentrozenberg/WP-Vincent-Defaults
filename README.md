# Vincent Defaults

A WordPress plugin that sets my preferred default options after a fresh WordPress installation.

## Description

Vincent Defaults is a personal plugin I created to automate my post-installation WordPress setup. It applies the tweaks and modifications I typically perform after setting up a new WordPress site, saving me time and ensuring consistency across my projects.

## What This Plugin Does

This plugin automates several tasks I usually perform after a fresh WordPress installation:

- Removes comment functionality entirely (I rarely use comments on my sites)
- Hides the admin bar for new users and on the front end (I prefer a cleaner front-end experience)
- Declutters the dashboard by removing:
  - WordPress Events and News
  - Activity widget
  - Quick Draft widget
- Removes Discussion Settings from the menu (since I disable comments)
- Automatically sets Discussion settings to disable comments on all posts and pages
- Removes the 'About WordPress' icon from the admin bar
- Hides the 'Thank you for creating with WordPress' message in the admin footer

## Why I Created This

I found myself performing these same tasks repeatedly on new WordPress installations. This plugin allows me to activate it once and have my preferred setup instantly, streamlining my workflow and ensuring I don't forget any of my usual tweaks.

## Installation

1. After a fresh WordPress installation, download this plugin.
2. Upload it to the `/wp-content/plugins/vincent-defaults` directory, or install it through the WordPress plugins screen.
3. Activate the plugin.

## Usage

Once activated, the plugin automatically applies all my preferred settings. No additional configuration is needed. I typically activate this plugin immediately after installing WordPress and before starting any site development.
